# Transfer Bridge Final Project
## Version 1.0.0

The game is technically not ready for a 1.0.0 version tag, yet this is the state in which the project was submitted. We were placed into teams of 4 and given roughly 2.5 days to create a game demonstrating the skills learned and honed by team CS during Transfer Bridge 2019. 

We used the first day for conceptualization, planning, UML diagramming, and finally the setup of our git repo. The rest of the time was utilized for coding and the execution of our outline.

Give the time constraints of the project, we found ourselves unable to complete all of our somewhat ambitious goals. Moving forward, we would like to complete and implement the additional features that were planned.
